# webweb!

webweb is a tool for displaying interactive network visualizations on the web! It's designed to make showing and sharing networks as easy as possible.

It's mostly written in javascript (making heavy use of [d3js](d3js.org)), and has interfaces for [MATLAB](http://danlarremore.com/webweb/) and [python](https://github.com/hneutr/webweb).

## Why though?
Sometimes, you just want to _see_ your adjacency list! You don't want to finagle with 400 libraries and debug, you just want to see it. Enter webweb.
