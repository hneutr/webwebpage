Let's say you have a set of people with first and last names and you want to see how the dataset looks when:
1. people with a common first name are connected
2. people with a common last name are connected

In other words, you have one set of nodes, but more than one definition of an edge.

Enter: webweb networks!

You can add multiple networks to a webweb visualization by naming them.
