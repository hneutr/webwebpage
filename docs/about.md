## who made it

[Dan Larremore](http://danlarremore.com) made this! [Hunter Wapman](https://hneutr.github.io) worked on it too. Michael Iuzzolino first made the python interface.

Some other people helped too.

## why though?

Sometimes, you need to see a network _right now_ -- You don't want to finagle 400 libraries or debug, you just want to see it. Right. Now. Enter webweb.

## how

The driver for webweb is written in javascript, and makes heavy use of [d3js](d3js.org).

The website is made using the static site-generator [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It uses a customized version of the jekyll theme [just the docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/).
