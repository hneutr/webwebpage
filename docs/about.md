## why

## how

The driver for webweb is written in javascript, and makes heavy use of [d3js](d3js.org).

The website is made using the static site-generator [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It uses a customized version of the jekyll theme [just the docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/).
